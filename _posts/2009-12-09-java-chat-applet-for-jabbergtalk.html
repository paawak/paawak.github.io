<p>Over the weekend, I have been working on a chat client based on XMPP. It will work for all Jabber servers as well as GTalk.</p>
<h3>How it all started</h3>
<p>A friend of mine had requested me if I could support chat on his website. I was googling a bit. I am a big fan of Jabber since its open source and based on XMPP. I came&nbsp; across this page listing all Jabber clients: http://xmpp.org/software/clients.shtml, and I was trying out the web one.<br />
I was awed by <a title="Claros Chat" href="http://www.claros.org/web/showProduct.do?id=2" target="_blank">Claros Chat</a>. Its a fabulous web-based chat client and has the look and feel of GTalk. I thought of taking advantage of its open source. So I downloaded the tar and was generally browsing through the contents when I came across <a title="Smack API" href="http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/smack/index.jsp" target="_blank">smack</a>. Now this is the core library which powers Claros. It provides a pure java implementation of the XMPP protocols. Its very well written. And it was not long before I started using it to write my own chat applet, based on Swings. People will find smack.jar and smackx.jar in its various versions in <a title="Maven Repo" href="http://repo2.maven.org/maven2/" target="_self">this maven repo</a> under <em>jivesoftware</em>. A word of warning, the latest version <em>3.1.0</em> is still beta and did not work for me. I am using <em>3.0.4</em>.</p>
<h3>Demo time</h3>

Click <a title="Chat Applet" href="/assets/resources/java/chat-client/chat.html" target="_blank">here</a> to view the applet.<br />
You would need JRE 1.6 to view this. Its still in very early stages of development and there are lots of bugs. But I guess the basic functions are in there, the UI sucks though. I will fix it as soon as I get some time, meanwhile, please bear up :)</p>
