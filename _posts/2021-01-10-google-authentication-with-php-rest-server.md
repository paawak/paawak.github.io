# Introduction
In our previous post, [Google Authentication with ReactJS and Typescript](http://palashray.com/google-authentication-with-reactjs-and-typescript/) we saw how to integrate our Frontend Application with Google Authentication. Today, we will see how to integrate our PHP Backend to authenticate with Google. For this, we will build on top of our previous blog [Creating REST Service with PHP from a Java programmerâ€™s perspective](http://palashray.com/creating-rest-service-with-php-from-a-java-programmers-perspective/).
