<p class="entryContent">I am using Fedora 7. To begin with, glchess used to work fine for me. Then suddenly it stopped working. It was giving a strange error. After googling a bit, I realised that it stopped working because I upgraded my Python from 2.0 to 2.5. Lucky for me though, I had python2 in my /usr/bin. So, this is the fix: I opened <em>/usr/bin/glchess</em>, and changed the header to</p>
<div><strong><em>!  /usr/bin/python2</em></strong></div>
<p>And voila, it started working again!<br />
The moral of the story is, glchess does not work with Python 2.5. It needs Python 2.</p>
