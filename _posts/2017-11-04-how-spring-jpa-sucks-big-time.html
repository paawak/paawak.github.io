<p>Ok, so all I am trying to do is save a new Entity into the DB and then retrieving it using its ID.</p>
<h3>Saving my Entity</h3>
<p>The entity Book contains an Author, some Chapters and some Genres as shown below:</p>
<pre class="lang:java decode:true ">@Entity
@Table(name = "BOOK")
public class Book implements Serializable {
	private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
	@Id
	@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.SEQUENCE, generator = "bookIdGenerator")
	@SequenceGenerator(name = "bookIdGenerator", sequenceName = "SEQ_BOOK_ID")
	@Column(name = "id")
	private Long id;
	@Column(name = "title")
	private String title;
	@OneToOne(fetch = FetchType.EAGER)
	@JoinColumn(name = "author_id")
	private Author author;
	@OneToOne(fetch = FetchType.EAGER, cascade = { CascadeType.PERSIST, CascadeType.MERGE })
	@JoinColumn(name = "main_chapter_id")
	private Chapter mainChapter;
	@OneToMany(fetch = FetchType.EAGER)
	@JoinTable(name = "BOOK_GENRE", joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "book_id", referencedColumnName = "id"), inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "genre_id", referencedColumnName = "id"))
	private Set<Genre> genres;</pre>
<p>While saving, the assumption is that the Author and the Genres are already present in the DB. While saving a new Book, I pass all the attributes of the Book and the Chapters. However, since the Author and the Genres are already present in the DB, I am passing their IDs only and not all of their attributes; pretty much like a Foreign Key. I am illustrating this with the below JSON:</p>
<pre class="lang:js decode:true ">{
  "title": "The Bazilian Cat",
  "author": {
    "id": 10
  },
  "mainChapter": {
    "title": "main CHAPTER for brazilian cat",
    "plotSummary": null,
    "contents": {
      "id": 30
    },
    "subChapters": [
      {
        "title": "aaaaa",
        "plotSummary": null,
        "contents": {
          "id": 1
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "genres": [
    {
      "id": 3
    },
    {
      "id": 2
    }
  ]
}</pre>
<p>Note that for <em>author</em> and <em>genres</em>, we are only passing their IDs and no other attributes.</p>
<h3>Fetching the Entity I just now saved</h3>
<p>Now, after saving the new Book, when I fetch, my expectation is that Spring-JPA fetches the entire object graph faithfully, without missing any attributes. In reality, it never even bothers to hit the DB with a query, but returns the Book from the Session Cache itself. So, when I fetch my newly saved Book, only the IDs are fetched for Author and Genre, and no other attribute.</p>
<h3>Implementation details with Spring JPA</h3>
<h4>Repository Layer</h4>
<p>The interface BookDao defines the contract.</p>
<pre class="lang:java decode:true ">public interface BookDao {
	Book getBook(Long bookId);
	Long saveNewBook(Book book);
}</pre>
<p>The implementation looks like:</p>
<pre class="lang:java decode:true ">public class JpaBasedBookDao implements BookDao {
	private static final Logger LOGGER = LoggerFactory.getLogger(JpaBasedBookDao.class);
	private final JpaRepository<Book, Long> bookRepo;
	public JpaBasedBookDao(JpaRepository<Book, Long> bookRepo) {
		this.bookRepo = bookRepo;
	}
	@Transactional(readOnly = true)
	@Override
	public Book getBook(Long bookId) {
		LOGGER.info("retrieving book with id: {}", bookId);
		return bookRepo.findOne(bookId);
	}
	@Transactional
	@Override
	public Long saveNewBook(Book book) {
		LOGGER.info("saving book: {}", book);
		return bookRepo.saveAndFlush(book).getId();
	}
}
</pre>
<h4>Service Layer</h4>
<pre class="lang:java decode:true ">@Service
public class BookServiceImpl implements BookService {
	private final BookDao bookRepo;
	@Autowired
	public BookServiceImpl(BookDao bookRepo) {
		this.bookRepo = bookRepo;
	}
	@Override
	public Book getBook(Long bookId) {
		return bookRepo.getBook(bookId);
	}
	@Override
	public Book saveOrUpdate(Book book) {
		Long id = bookRepo.saveNewBook(book);
		return bookRepo.getBook(id);
	}
}</pre>
<p>Note that the Transactions are started in the Repository layer. So, when I do a saveOrUpdate() in my service, there are 2 transactions that are happening. However, despite that, the Book is returned from the Session Cache and I get an incomplete object graph. Spring JPA does not give me much leverage to clear or evict or refresh the Session Cache after the insert happens.</p>
<h3>Implementing with standard JPA</h3>
<p>This can be handled better with the plain vanilla JPA. This is how the Repository looks like:</p>
<pre class="lang:java decode:true">public class EntityManagerBasedBookDao implements BookDao {
	private static final Logger LOGGER = LoggerFactory.getLogger(EntityManagerBasedBookDao.class);
	private final EntityManager entityManager;
	public EntityManagerBasedBookDao(EntityManager entityManager) {
		this.entityManager = entityManager;
	}
	@Transactional(readOnly = true)
	@Override
	public Book getBook(Long bookId) {
		LOGGER.info("retrieving book with id: {}", bookId);
		Book book = entityManager.find(Book.class, bookId);
		entityManager.refresh(book);
		return book;
	}
	@Transactional
	@Override
	public Long saveNewBook(Book book) {
		LOGGER.info("saving book: {}", book);
		entityManager.persist(book);
		return book.getId();
	}
}</pre>
<p>The below line is particularly important in the method <em>getBook(Long bookId)</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>entityManager.refresh(book);</p></blockquote>
<p>Without the above line, we will still get an incomplete object graph.</p>
