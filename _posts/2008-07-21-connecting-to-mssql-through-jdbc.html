<p>I was not able to connect to MsSql using JDBC. I was using the host with the port no. like:<br />
<em>jdbc:jtds:sqlserver//localhost:3683/TestDB</em><br />
I would always get "Connection refused" exception.<br />
Then I chucked out the port no. from the host name, and it works fine now.<br />
<em>jdbc:jtds:sqlserver://localhost/TestDB</em></p>
