<p>I am very fascinated with Postgres, right since I hard about it, around 2002. Compared to MySQL 3.25, which was and perhaps still is, more popular, Postgres fared a lot better in terms of SQL-compliance, foreign-key support [which was lacking in MySQL 3.25] etc. Also, Postgres is an ORDBMS, just like Oracle. You can do lot of cool stuff with Postgres.<br />
For this exercise, we will assume:<br />
Postgres user name = <em>mypguser</em><br />
Postgres data directory =<em> /usr/local/pgsql/data</em><br />
If you are using Fedora, Postgres will be installed by default. To verify, do a find on <em>initdb</em> and <em>psql</em>. If you do not have it installed, install it with yum or grab a tar ball from <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/" target="_blank">here</a> and follow the instructions. Its pretty straight forward.<br />
After you have installed, run the following commands:<br />
#adduser mypguser<br />
#passwd mypguser<br />
#mkdir /usr/local/pgsql/data<br />
#chown mypguser /usr/local/pgsql/data<br />
#su - mypguser<br />
$initdb -D /usr/local/pgsql/data</p>
<h3>Starting Postgres</h3>
<p>Postmaster should always be started as the underprivileged user <em>mypguser</em>.<br />
$postgres -D /usr/local/pgsql/data >logfile 2>&amp;1 &amp;<br />
To create a database:<br />
createdb somedatabase<br />
To start the command line tool:<br />
psql somedatabase</p>
<h3>Autostart Postgres as a service</h3>
<p>Fedora should already have this script in /etc/init.d/postgresql.<br />
The problem is that this assumes that the postgres user name is <em>postgres</em> and the data is located in <em>/var/lib/pgsql/data</em>. You can edit the script suitably and then enable it as a service, so that postmaster starts everytime your system boots up. You can also use the script that I have modified, just declared the user and data as variables. You can find it <a href="http://palashray.com/resources/scripts/postgresql">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Installing PgAdmin</h3>
<p>PgAdmin is a nice gui frontend for administratin Postgres. You have to first add its yum repository. Follow these steps [you must be super user].<br />
1. download rpm and add yum repository:<br />
<a href="http://yum.pgsqlrpms.org/reporpms/repoview/letter_p.group.html" target="_blank">http://yum.pgsqlrpms.org/reporpms/repoview/letter_p.group.html</a><br />
2. yum install postgis<br />
3. yum install pgadmin3<br />
You can also use <a href="http://phppgadmin.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">phpPgAdmin</a>.<br />
For this article, I was inspired by:<br />
