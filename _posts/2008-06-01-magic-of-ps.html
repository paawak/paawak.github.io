<p class="entryContent">
<p>The command<br />
$ps -eF<br />
lists all process along-with the full command which started the process. When I ran this, I could not see the entire command due the width restriction of my terminal. This is the solution to set unlimited width:<br />
$ps -eF -w -w<br />
Now, suppose I want to know a specific process by its name:<br />
$ps -F -C java -w -w<br />
The -C option accepts a list of process name like:<br />
$ps -F -C "java xmms" -w -w<br />
For a list of files opened by a process, use<br />
$/usr/sbin/lsof -p 3456 | grep XXXX<br />
