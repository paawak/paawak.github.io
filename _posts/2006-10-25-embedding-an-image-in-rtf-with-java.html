<p>Ever wondered how to embed images in RTF docs? I was trying to do that for a couple of days...<br />
The blasted MS Office application has obfuscated the RTF format so badly, that it is difficult to read it by opening it in another simple editor like NotePad or TextPad. A beginner like me is lost simply in the sheer volume of redundant control words and back-slashes.<br />
So, if you want to learn the RTF format frtom the pros, a good idea to install <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice</a> (you can dowload it for free) in your PC and save the documents in RTF format and opening them in NotePad or TextPad.<br />
Some basics facts about RTF format:</p>
<ul>
<li>All RTF control words start with a back-slash</li>
<li>All RTF documents should start with <span style="font-weight: bold;">{rtf1ansi</span> and end with a <span style="font-weight: bold;">}</span></li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to embed a picture, you have to write the entire binary data of the picture in the RTF file. This is done as follows:<br />
<span>{*shppict{pictpicw800pich600jpegblip</span><br />
<span>ffd8ffe000104a46494600010201006000600000ffed182e50686f746f73686f</span><br />
<span>7020332e30003842494d03ed0a5265736f6c7574696f6e000000001000600000</span><br />
<span>0001000100600000000100013842494d040d18465820476c6f62616c204c6967}}</span><br />
<span>picw800</span> dictates that the picture is <span style="font-style: italic;">800 pixels</span> wide.<br />
Similarly, <span>pich600</span> means that the height of the picture is <span style="font-style: italic;">600 pixels</span>.<br />
<span>jpegblip</span> is used when the given image is in JPEG format. For PNG images, use <span>pngblip<span>.</span></span><br />
After these control words, the actual binary data of the image starts.<br />
The following rules are followed:</p>
<ol>
<li>The raw data is from the image file is read in bytes and formatted as hexadecimal values.</li>
<li>If a given byte is single digit, it is prepended by <span style="font-weight: bold;">0</span>. For example, if a byte value is <span style="font-weight: bold;">f</span>, it is made <span style="font-weight: bold;">0f</span>.</li>
<li>When all the bytes are written, immediately indicate the end of the data by closing the braces.</li>
</ol>
<p>The second point is most important.<br />
Given below is the java source-code. In order to make it look nice, I have gone to a new line after every 64 bytes of raw data. But this is not necessary.</p>
<pre lang="java">import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;
import javax.swing.ImageIcon;
public class PictureReader {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
  String ImageName = "/images/WaterLilies.jpg";
  InputStream imageIp = PictureReader.class.getResourceAsStream(ImageName);
  ImageIcon icon = new ImageIcon(PictureReader.class.getResource(ImageName));
  StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer("{rtf1ansiparpardplain");
  sb.append("n{*shppict{pict")
  .append("picw").append(icon.getIconWidth())
  .append("pich").append(icon.getIconHeight())
  .append("jpegblipn"); //   for PNG images, use pngblip
  int count = 0;
  while(true) {
   try {
    int i = imageIp.read();
    if (i == -1) {
     break;
    }
    String hexStr = Integer.toHexString(i);
    if (hexStr.length() == 1) {
     hexStr = "0" + hexStr;
    }
    count += 2;
    sb.append(hexStr);
    if (count == 64) {
     count = 0;
     sb.append("n");
    }
   } catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
   }
  }
  sb.append("}}n}n");
  try {
   FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream("Pic.rtf");
   fos.write(sb.toString().getBytes());
  } catch (IOException e) {
   e.printStackTrace();
  }
 }
}</pre>
